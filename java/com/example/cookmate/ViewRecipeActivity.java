                    "Heat oil in a wok or pan over medium-low or medium heat. For a heavy pan, keep medium heat and for a less heavy pan, use a medium-low heat. The oil should have a temperature of 135 degrees Celsius (275 degrees Fahrenheit).\n" +
                    "Now, working in batches, add the potatoes to the oil. Do not overcrowd the wok (kadai) or pan with the potatoes. The oil will sizzle and bubble less when you fry the potatoes at this temperature.\n" +
                    "Stir at intervals while frying them for uniform cooking.\n" +
                    "Fry/blanch in oil for about 3 minutes or until the potatoes are cooked, but not brown from outside. They should just get a crust from outside without any major color change. Light browning of the edges is fine. Remove with a slotted spoon.\n" +
                    "Place the half fried potatoes on paper kitchen towels. Stack 3 to 4 paper towels. Press some paper towels from top also to absorb extra oil. Let the half fried potatoes cool down at room temperature. \n" +
                    "Note that after removing this batch, you can fry the second batch of potatoes. By the time you fry the second batch of the potatoes, the first batch will cool down. So even though you have to fry twice, you’re using the same batch of oil all the way through.\n" +
                    "Second Frying\n" +
                    "Now increase the heat to a medium-high or high. Again here for a heavy pan, use a high heat and for a less heavy pan, use medium-high heat. The oil should be hot on medium-high to high heat having a temperature of 180 to 185 degrees celsius (356 to 365 degrees Fahrenheit).\n" +
                    "Add the first batch of once-fried potatoes to the hot oil. The oil will sizzle and bubble quickly and as soon as you add the potatoes.\n" +
                    "Stir often while the potatoes fry to cook them evenly. Fry french fries for 3 minutes or until crisp and golden. The edges should become golden. Remove with a slotted spoon.\n" +
                    "Place french fries on paper tissues again to remove the extra oil.\n",

                    "Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add pasta and cook until tender, 6 to 10 minutes (check the package for recommended cook time). Drain and rinse well under cold water.\n" +
                    "While the pasta cooks, in the bottom of a large bowl, make the dressing. Whisk the red wine vinegar, salt, pepper, oregano, pepperoncini juice (if using), and the olive oil until blended. Add the drained and rinsed pasta to the dressing and mix well.\n" +
                    "Stir in the bell pepper, zucchini, tomatoes, scallions, pepperoncini (if using), olives, parmesan, mozzarella, and the herbs (if using). Taste for seasoning and adjust with salt and pepper as needed. Serve or for the best results, cover and refrigerate at least 30 minutes and up to 5 days.\n",

                    "First rinse and then boil 4 medium sized potatoes in 2 cups water for 5 to 6 whistles in a pressure cooker. You can also boil potatoes in a pan or in an Instant pot. The potatoes have to be completely cooked and fork tender.\n" +
                    "When the potaoes are cooking, soak the chana dal in hot water for 30 minutes. Then drain the chana dal and keep aside.\n" +
                    "When the pressure settles down on its own in the cooker, remove the lid. Drain the water from the potatoes and let them become warm. Then peel and chop them.\n" +

                    "Making potato filling\n" +
                    "Heat oil or ghee in a frying pan or a skillet. Fry cashews and keep aside. This step of frying cashews is optional.\n" +

                    "Add water. Mix well and simmer for 2 to 3 minutes or till the mixture thickens a bit.\n" +
                    "Next add the boiled chopped potatoes and mix very well. You can also mash the potatoes if you like while cooking them.\n" +
                    "Season with salt according to taste. Also add ¼ teaspoon sugar for a slight sweet taste.\n" +
                    "Simmer on a low flame for 3 to 4 minutes stirring occasionally. The water will reduce and the consistency will thicken. \n" +
                    "Switch off the flame and then add chopped coriander leaves. Also add the fried cashews now and mix well. The potato filling should be moist and easily spreadable on the dosa. Make sure there is no water in the potato filling. It should not be of a curry or gravy consistency.\n" +
                    "Stir and keep the potato filling aside.\n" +
                    "Making masala dosa\n" +
                    "Lightly stir the batter, before you begin to make dosa. You will also see tiny air pockets in the batter and it would have increased in volume.\n" +
                    "Heat a cast iron pan or a flat non-stick pan. The pan should be medium hot. Smear some oil if using an iron pan or griddle. Don't smear oil on a non stick pan, as then you won't be able to spread the batter.\n" +
